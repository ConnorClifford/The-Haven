        <h1>So You Found an Animal?</h1>
          <p>Before you call us, please read the following:</p>
          <p>Most animals give birth during the spring time which also makes this OUR busiest
             time of year. You can help by learning when to rescue!</p>
          <p>It is an old wive's tale that an animal's mother will not accept it once a human
            has touched it (yes, including birds). If you know where the nest is and that the
             mother is around it can be placed back in its nest.</p>

        <h3 style="color:red">Injured Adult Animals</h3>
        <p>Injured animals can be very aggressive and may be ill. If an animal appears
           ill, use extreme caution and place a heavy box with adequate ventilation
            over it and contact a rehabilitator or you local animal control agency.</p>

      <h3>Baby Animals</h3>
      <div class="group">
        <h4 style="color:red">Raccoons, Foxes, Skunks</h4>
          <p>These animals are potential rabies carriers. You should contact us or any other
             rehabber before attempting to handle them.</p>
          <p>Please call us at: (407) 260-6137</p>

        <h4>Birds</h4>
          <p>If the baby is not fully feathered try placing it back in the nest if possible.
             If the nest is too high you can hang a grass-lined basket or a plastic container
              (with holes poked in the bottom for drainage in case of rain) in the same or
               a nearby tree. Watch from a distance for about 20 minutes and if the mother
                is OK she will return to care for it. If this fails, contact a rehabilitator.</p>

          <p>If the baby IS fully feathered, has tail feathers and is hopping on the ground,
             it is a fledgling. This is a normal learning stage and the mother is very likely
              nearby feeding it. You may place the bird back in the nest if it is within reach,
               but chances are he will hop right back out. This is a very necessary stage at
                which the young bird learns how to fly, how to find food and to watch out for
                 predators. The birds mother can teach him these things much better than we
                  can, please leave these birds be. Fledglings will be flying within a couple
                   of days, so if you have cats, perhaps they could stay inside for a short
                    time.</p>

        <h4>Squirrels</h4>
          <p>If a baby squirrel falls from it's nest, leave it be and watch from a distance
             for a short time. If the mother is around she will likely retrieve it. If the
              nest is destroyed, give the mother a chance to move the babies because she
               usually has a second nest built for just such an occasion! If the baby is
               injured or appears sick , place it in a warm dark place and contact a rehabber.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="group">
        <h4>Bunnies</h4>
          <p>Mother hares spend less than one hour per day with their babies. They forage
             during the day and return only at dusk and dawn to feed their babies. If you
              uncover a nest of infants, leave them be and check them again in the morning.
              If they appear round and plump, the mother has been back to care for them.
              If you are unsure, contact a rehabber before removing them.</p>

        <h4>Opossums</h4>
          <p>Opossums ride on their mothers back or in their pouch until they are about 8
            inches long. If you find a small opossum wandering by himself, scoop him into
             a well-ventilated box with a towel and call a rehabber.</p>
